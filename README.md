When starting a project for a client it is very important to meet with the client and listen to what their vision for their product is.  If we can understand their vision, we can deliver a product that suits their needs.  The creation of user stories is a component that can be used to begin to populate the backlog with events that need to happen in the program.  
When it comes time to develop the program, I try to take my user stories and try to prioritize what needs to be completed so that way there is a deliverable product at the end of a sprint.  As I progress with my development work, I plan to use the estimation process to determine how to organize my workload and to ensure that I can make my deadlines. I also plan to try to improve my communication skills because when it comes to developing software being able to communicate within the team and with clients is key.
Being a good team member in software development means being able to communicate clearly and concisely with your teammates.  Whether it means that if maybe running behind letting your team know that you may need extra help or if you are going to be ahead seeing if you are able to assist anyone that is having trouble.  Another good quality would be a willingness to help wherever they can to help the team achieve their goals.
